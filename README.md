- 👋 Hi, I’m @Loken00
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about coding and developing through both my studies(Information Science) and through github.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and have slightly touched HTML&CSS, SQL, Json and XML through my studies. I have also planned to learn Java/JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that will help me develop and enhance my knowledge and skills. Prefferably projects using Python.
- 📫 How to reach me: Just send me a message :)
